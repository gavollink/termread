# Lion 			( 10.7,  11       )
# Mountain Lion	( 10.8,  12       )  64bit INTEL Darwin only
# Mavericks 	( 10.9,  13       )
# Yosemite 		( 10.10, 14       )  My oldest MBAir is here

# Sonoma  		( 14, 	 23       )  I don't have access to this yet
#
# So Tiger (10.4, D8) on 64bit would be the oldest theoretical x86_64 target
# but Mountain Lion (10.8, D12) is more realistic because it's the first
# place we're guaranteed to see a 64bit Darwin.
# I don't even know if it CAN be targeted anymore, or if it would work.
# So, since I can test Yosemite and know it works, that is what this
# Makefile does, the info here is for those who have older stuff and want to
# fiddle around with trying to support it with a UNIVERSAL binary.
#
# Real talk... All Apple hardware sold from 2010 on supports Yosemite
# or newer.  That's 13 years ago, which is forever for Apple hardware.
